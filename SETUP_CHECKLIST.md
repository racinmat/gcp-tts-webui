ðŸ“‹ **Detailed guide**: [OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## âœ… Application Setup

### Installation
- [ ] Repository cloned/downloaded
- [ ] Dependencies installed with `npm install`
- [ ] Environment variables configured (see below)

### Environment Configuration
Choose one of these options:

**Option A: Using .env file (Recommended)**
- [ ] Copied `env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Updated `.env` with your credentials:
  ```env
  PORT=3000
  SESSION_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./tts-service-account-key.json
  NODE_ENV=development
  ```

**Option B: Using config.js**
- [ ] Copied `config.example.js` to `config.js`
- [ ] Updated `config.js` with your credentials

## âœ… Testing Your Setup

### Quick Test
- [ ] Run `npm start` or `npm run dev`
- [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google" 
- [ ] Successfully authenticate with Google
- [ ] See language/voice selection dropdowns populate
- [ ] Enter test text and generate speech
- [ ] Audio plays successfully in browser

### Troubleshooting
If something doesn't work:
- [ ] Check console logs for error messages
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Ensure service account key file path is correct
- [ ] Confirm OAuth2 redirect URIs match exactly
- [ ] Check that APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console

## âœ… Security Verification

- [ ] Service account key file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore` 
- [ ] No credentials are hardcoded in source files
- [ ] OAuth2 redirect URIs only include necessary domains
- [ ] Session secret is strong and unique

## âœ… Production Deployment (Optional)

If deploying to production:
- [ ] Update OAuth2 redirect URIs with production domain
- [ ] Set environment variables on production server
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Update OAuth consent screen with production URLs
- [ ] Consider using managed secret storage

## Common File Locations

After setup, your project should look like:
```
gcp-tts-webui/
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                          # Your environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ tts-service-account-key.json  # Your service account key
â”œâ”€â”€ config.js                     # Your config file (if using Option B)
â””â”€â”€ ... (other project files)
```
