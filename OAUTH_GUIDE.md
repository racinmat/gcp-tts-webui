# Google OAuth2 Complete Guide

## Overview

This application uses **OAuth-only authentication**, eliminating the need for service accounts. All Text-to-Speech API calls are made on behalf of the authenticated user, providing a simpler and more secure setup.

## What Makes This Different

### ‚úÖ **Simplified Setup Process**
- **No service accounts needed!**
- **No JSON key files to manage**
- **Single OAuth2 setup handles both authentication and API access**

### üîß **How It Works**
- Users authenticate with Google OAuth2
- The app receives an access token with Text-to-Speech API permissions
- All API calls are made using the user's credentials
- No backend service account credentials required

## Prerequisites

- Google account
- Access to Google Cloud Console
- Basic understanding of OAuth2 concepts

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Access Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. If you don't have a project, create one first (see [Project Setup](#project-setup))

### 2. Enable Required APIs

Before setting up OAuth2, ensure you have the necessary APIs enabled:

1. In the Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services** > **Library**
2. Search for and enable these APIs:
   - **Cloud Text-to-Speech API** (for TTS functionality)
   - **Google+ API** (for user profile information - optional)

### 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

This is **required** before creating OAuth2 credentials:

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
2. Choose **External** user type (unless you're using Google Workspace)
3. Click **CREATE**

#### Fill in OAuth Consent Screen Information:

**App Information:**
- **App name**: `Text-to-Speech Web App` (or your preferred name)
- **User support email**: Your email address
- **App logo**: Optional, but recommended

**App domain information:**
- **Application home page**: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
- **Application privacy policy link**: Optional for development
- **Application terms of service link**: Optional for development

**Developer contact information:**
- **Email addresses**: Your email address

4. Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**

**Scopes (Step 2) - IMPORTANT:**
- Click **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES**
- Add the following scopes:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` (for Text-to-Speech API)
  - `profile` (for user profile information)
  - `email` (for user email)
- Click **UPDATE** and then **SAVE AND CONTINUE**

**Test users (Step 3):**
- Add email addresses of users who can test your app
- Include your own email address
- Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**

5. Review the summary and click **BACK TO DASHBOARD**

### 4. Create OAuth2 Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS**
3. Select **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**

#### Configure OAuth2 Client:

1. **Application type**: Select **Web application**

2. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "TTS Web App OAuth Client")

3. **Authorized JavaScript origins**: Add these URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   https://localhost:3000
   ```
   *Note: Add your production domain when deploying*

4. **Authorized redirect URIs**: Add these URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
   https://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
   ```
   *Note: Add your production callback URL when deploying*

5. Click **CREATE**

### 5. Download and Save Credentials

After creating the OAuth2 client:

1. A dialog will appear with your credentials
2. **Copy the Client ID** - This is your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
3. **Copy the Client Secret** - This is your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
4. Click **DOWNLOAD JSON** to save the credentials file (optional but recommended)

### 6. Update Your Environment Variables

Add the credentials to your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret-here
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
```

## Required OAuth2 Scopes

The application requires these OAuth2 scopes:
- `profile` - For user profile information
- `email` - For user email address
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` - For Text-to-Speech API access

## Project Setup

If you don't have a Google Cloud project:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click the project selector at the top
3. Click **NEW PROJECT**
4. Enter project details:
   - **Project name**: `tts-web-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Location**: Leave as default or select your organization
5. Click **CREATE**
6. Wait for the project to be created and select it

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. **Update OAuth2 Client Settings**:
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
   - Click on your OAuth2 client
   - Add your production domain to:
     - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: `https://yourdomain.com`
     - **Authorized redirect URIs**: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback`

2. **Update OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Change **Application home page** to your production URL
   - Add proper privacy policy and terms of service links
   - Submit for verification if needed

## Testing Your Setup

1. Start your application: `npm start`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. You should be redirected to Google's OAuth screen
5. **Important**: You'll be prompted to grant permissions for Text-to-Speech API access
6. After authorization, you should be redirected back to your app
7. Voice selection should populate with available voices

## Benefits of OAuth-Only Approach

### üéØ **Simplified Setup**
- One less credential type to manage
- No JSON key files to secure
- Fewer configuration steps

### üîê **Enhanced Security**
- No service account keys to rotate
- User-based permissions and access control
- OAuth token management handled by Google

### üë• **Better User Experience**
- Users authenticate once and get immediate access
- No need to share service account permissions
- Natural user-based quota and billing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Access blocked" error**:
   - Ensure your app is added to test users in OAuth consent screen
   - Check that redirect URIs match exactly (including protocol)

2. **"Invalid client" error**:
   - Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
   - Check that the callback URL matches your configuration

3. **"Consent screen not configured"**:
   - Complete the OAuth consent screen setup first
   - Ensure all required fields are filled

4. **"Insufficient Permission" errors**:
   - Verify the `cloud-platform` scope is included in OAuth2 configuration
   - Check that the user has access to the Google Cloud project
   - Ensure Text-to-Speech API is enabled

5. **"API not enabled" error**:
   - Enable Text-to-Speech API in APIs & Services > Library
   - Wait a few minutes after enabling

6. **Voice loading fails**:
   - Verify user has appropriate permissions in the Google Cloud project
   - Check console logs for detailed error messages
   - Ensure project ID is correct in configuration

### Security Best Practices:

1. **Keep credentials secure**:
   - Never commit Client Secret to version control
   - Use environment variables for credentials
   - Rotate credentials periodically

2. **Restrict domains**:
   - Only add necessary domains to authorized origins
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Validate redirect URIs carefully

3. **Monitor usage**:
   - Check API usage in Cloud Console
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Monitor for unusual activity

## Migration from Service Account Setup

If you're migrating from a service account setup:

### For Existing Installations
1. **Update your `.env` file**:
   ```env
   # Remove this line:
   # GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account-key.json
   ```

2. **Update OAuth2 Scopes**:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Edit your OAuth2 client
   - Add the scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`

3. **Clear existing sessions**: Users may need to log out and log back in

4. **Remove service account files** from your project

## Security Considerations

### Advantages
- ‚úÖ No service account keys to manage or rotate
- ‚úÖ User-based access control
- ‚úÖ OAuth token refresh handled automatically
- ‚úÖ Permissions tied to user's Google Cloud access

### Considerations
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Users need appropriate Google Cloud project permissions
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è API quotas and billing tied to user's project access
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è OAuth tokens have limited lifetime (handled automatically)
